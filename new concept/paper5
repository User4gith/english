leave to doubt then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves.
Let us get down to fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings
people just like their elders. There is only one difference between and old man and
a young one: the young man has a glorious future before him and the old one has
a splendid future behind him: and maybe that is where the rub is.

When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and uncertain-that I was a new
boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something
so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity,
and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking.

I find young people exciting. They have an air of freedom, and they have not a

presumptuous or fatuous, but i do not turn for protection to dreary cliches about respect
for elders-as if mere age were a reason for respect.
