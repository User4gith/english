It was quite sunny when we set off. we enjoyed the beautiful view of nature all the way. However, just about half way to the top of the mountain, the rain began to pour down. At the same time, a strong wind blew. There was no doubt that a storm was coming. we looked for a place to escape the rain, but it was in vain, so we had to walk back down the mountain.
