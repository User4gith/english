I am going to talk about one of my favourite educational TV programmes, which is a nature documentary called Planet earth. There were elevn episodes of this programme, and each one featured a different habitat on Earth, such as mountains, caves, deserts and jungles. The aim of the planet earth series was to take the viewer into those habitats, using spectacular footage of interesting animals, plants and landscapes.

My interests are manifold, including jogging, reading and playing computer games.

I enjoy reading books in my leisure time.





I am going to talk about one of my favourite educational TV programmes, which is a nature documentary called planet earth. There are eleven episodes of this programme, and each one featured a diffferent habitat on earth, such as mountains, caves, deserts and jungles. The aim of planet earth series was to take the viewer into those habitats, using spectacular footage of interesting animals, plants and landscapes.

I first saw planet earth on television when it was broadcast by the bbc several years ago, I think it was shown every sunday evening, which was the perfect time to watch a fascinating nature programme. Then, a few years ago, somebody bought me the dvd box set of the whole series as a christmas present, and I watched the episodes again.

The tv trailers were really eye-catching because they showed incredibly beautiful images of nature. I also recognised the voice of the narrator of the programme. It was these trailers that persuaded me to watch the first episode.

What I like most about the planet earth series was its stunning photography and its global scope. For example, in the fresh water episode, they showed us crocodiles in the river nile, and river doiphines in the amazon. I was amazed at how they had managed to film such interesting creatures in so many locations. I enjoyed learning about strange animal species, and the programme opened my eyes to the hidden wonder of our planet.

It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste. Although I accept that new legislation to force poeple to recycle could help this situation, I believe that a new recycling law would not be the only measure that governments should take.

On the one hand, I believe that a new recycling law is just one possible way to tackle the waste problem. Governments could make it a legal obligation for householders to separate all waste into different bins. There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging form a small fine to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders. These measures would act as a deterrent and [encourage people to obey this law]. As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners would lead to a clean, waste free environment for everyone.

However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law. It might be more effective, if politicians put education, rather than punishment, at the centre of a recycling campaign. For example, children could be taught about recycling, and homeowners could be informed about the negative impact of household waste. Another tactic that governments could use would be to make stricter regulations for the companies that produce packaging for household products. At the same time, money could also be spent to improve recycling facilities and systems, so that waste could be processed more effectively, regardless of whether or not people recycle waste correctly in the home.

In conclusion, perhaps we do need to make recycling a legal requirement, but I believe that it would certainly not be the only way to encourage people to dispose of their waste more responsibly.

Well there are many laws in my country, but, to be honest, i am not familiar with most of them. The law i can think of now is that people are not allowed to drive after drinking alcohol.

I'd like to talk about my favourite season in beijing autumn.

Without the humid air of summer and the dusty wind of spring. autumn is comfortably cool and filled with beauty from the colourful leaves.

The reason why i like this season most is that it is an ideal season for outdoor activities like jogging and hiking.

One of special things in this season is that it is the harvest season. there are many fruits like apples and oranges. The other special thing is the mid autumn festival.

The mid autumn festival falls on the fiftenth day of the eighth lunar month, usually in september or october.

On that day, people ate mooncakes and light fireworks. Some people light fireworks all night and it is an source of air pollution and it is noisy

The mid autumn festival is an important part of chinese life, it represents unity and happiness.

Last summer, my mother and i went to climb mountain emei, a famous mountain located in southwest china. unfortunately, during the journey we got caught a terrible storm, which was the worst weathe i have experienced.

It was quite sunny when we set off. we enjoy the beautiful view of nature all the way. However, at the half way to the top of mountain, the rain poured down and a strong wind blew. There was no doubt a storm was coming, we had to went back down the mountain.

After we arrived at our hotel, my mother and i were totally soaked and got a terrible cold the next day. we had no choice but stay at hotel for two days. Our journey was ruined by this storm but it become the most unforgettable experience in my life.

I'd like to talk about the palace museum, which was also called the forbidden city.

The forbidden city is located in the centre of beijing.

It was the palace for royal family during the ming dynasty and qing dynasty. 24 emperors lived in the forbidden city, some of buildings were offices for emperor, some of them were for emperor's wives, children and other family members. There are many treasures and beautiful gardens. too.

The forbidden city is very interesting because we can know an emperor's life was like, before the forbidden city was open to the public, we could only know what en emperor's life looked like on tv. Besides, ordinary people were forbidden to walk inside without the emperor's permission, that is why it was called the forbidden city. now everyone can walk inside freely.

I'd like to talk about the grassland, it is located in the northeast inner mongolia.

You can see birds, flowers, cattle and sheep everywhere. Under the blue sky and white cloud, we have a view of boundless grassland, the grass land looks like a flat, green carpet.

Visitors usually go horseback riding, do archery or go grass skating, Visitors can also watch the performance presented by the mongolians. when proposing toasts to guests, they will show their hospitality by singing floksongs and playing special instruments.

It really lets people escape from their busy lives, and enter a place that looks like a dream world. It is hardly polluted, and there is a saying that it is the most pure grassland.

I'd like to talk about my best friend, he has been my friend for quite a long time.

I met him during the first day of college, since then we have become best friends and shared our ups and downs.

We have similar interests and he is a good companion to me. we do plenty of interesting thing together like going to the concerts and making social survey. we used to attend lectures and go to library to do research when we were in school, now we are both graduated, and we usually meet up and talk about our daily life and work.

The reason why i like to be with him is that we feel comfortable around each other. he is always by my side, and has seen me at my best and at my worst. I feel lucky to have a friend like him.


I'd like to talk about my cousin, he is my cousin on my mother's side.

He is slim although he eats a lot, he has short black hair and he also has a big smile.

he is excellent in sports and studies. i remember that he taught me how to play basketball when i was young. he always got good grades in school.

i like him not only because he is a sportsman but also he has been a good example for me. and he is a kind person, he always give me advice when i was in trouble.





i'd like to talk about my company leader, he is a kind person who has done a lot to help others.

i first met him when he inteviewed me, and i felt lucky to become a part of his staff when he hired me, i have worked with him for almost two years.

He lives quite near our company, and he comes to his office early.

In my opinion, he is a very helpful person. as an it expert, he always shares his knowledge with us, which help us make much progress in our field. Also, he likes giving us transparent feedback. Instead of telling us we are wrong, he likes giving the example of how we can improve, which help us improve our work efficiency.

He is a good leader who helps us a lot.

I was late for my first math class in the morning when i was in university, which was really an embarrassing experience for me.

It was mainly due to the fact that i did not hear my alarm go off, so i somehow overslept. Finally when i got to the classroom, i found that the back door was locked and i had to enter the room through the front door. It was really embarrassing that everyone saw me walk in late.

Now i try my best to be punctual. To be punctual is very important, it shows respect for others, and in turn, you acquire respect from others.

The most important change in my life is that i have developed a habit of getting up early. I used to sleep late at night and get up late in the morning. I felt tired easily and i could not focus my mind on my studies.

I realised that it was a bad start of my daily routine so i decided to make a positive change at the beginning of this year. I decided to sleep at ten o'clock and get up at seven o'clock, at first i felt quite uncomfortable but i used to it finally.

Now i am energetic and in a very positive mood all day long. Most importantly, i can focus my mind on my study and learning efficiency improve.

Last month, i came across a student he asked me to give my opinion in the questionnaire designed by him. This questionnaire was about what affect people's choice of health food.

He wanted to collect idea from different people, so he asked everyone he came across for help. i encountered him and he asked me whether i could do him a favour. i said yes.

to be honest, i was not familiar with this field, but i tried my best help him. i told him that People's income would affect their choice and people's knowledge about healthy food would also affect what they choose to eat.

I was glad to give my opinions because i an willing to help others.

I would like to talk about one of my favourite education programmes, which is a nature documentary called planet earth. there were eleven episodes of this programme and each one featured a different habitat on earth, such as mountains, caves, deserts and jungles. The aim of this programme was to take the viewer into those habitats, using spectacular footage of interesting animals, plants and landscapes.

i first saw this programme on tv when it was broadcast by the bbc several years ago, I think it was shown every sunday evening, which was the perfect time to watch a nature programme.

I found out about this programme because it was repeatedly advertised in the weeks before it was first aired. The trailers were really eye-catching, because it showed us incredibly beautiful images of nature, it was the trailers that presuaded me to watch the first episode.

what i like most about this programme was its stunning photography and its global scope. For example, in the fresh water episode, it showed us the crocodiles in the river Nile and dolphins in the Amazon. I was amazed at how they managed to film such interesting creatures in so many locations, I learnt about strange animal species and this programme opened my eyes to the hidden wonders of our planet.

I'd like my dream house to be on a mountain covered with the woods. my dream house would be a two storey house and big enough for my family and me.

Outside the house, i would like to paint it green, the same color as the leaves of trees of the woods. since we live near the woods, i would like to have a garden to plants flowers and raise pets. Inside the house, i would like to put a big table in the living room, so we will have enough space to have a party during the holidays.

I believe that everyone has a dream of having a peaceful land to live in, and so do i. i love cool breeze and the peaceful atmosphere of mountain areas. What's more, living a big house and with my family makes me feel fulfilled.

It is a local clothing brand, it produces clothes using natural materials, and it also has stylish clothes that are originally designed.

i know of this company because there is a store in my neighbourhood, and i buy my clothes there all the time. It is not surprisng that i am familiar with this company because it is the only store of this company one year ago, now it has five branches in the city.

There are two reasons why i like this company, firstly, it is beause of its clothes. they are comfortable and fashionable. the second reason is its service. the shop assistants of all stores are like personal stylist.





It is true that online courses are becoming a common feature of university education. Although ther are many drawbacks of internet-based learning, i believe that there are far more benefits.

the main drawback of this trend towards online university courses is that there is less direct interaction. Students may not have the opportunity to engage face to face with their teachers, and they will instead have to rely on the written forms of communication. Similarly, students who study online can not come to direct contact with each other, this may have a negative impact of peer support, discuassion and exchange of ideas. For example, whereas students in traditional courses can attend seminars and discuss their subjects over coffee after class, online students are restricted to chatting trough website forum areas. Online students might also lack the motivation and the element of competition that face to face group work brings.

Despite the drawbacks mentioned above, there are several reasons why i believe that online courses are a positive trend. Firstly, they allow people to study in a flexible way, meaning that students can study whenever and wherever is convenient and thye can cover the materials at their own pace. Secondly, the cost of an university education could be greatly reduced, while revenues for institutions will increase as more students could be taught. Finally, online courses offer open access to everyone, regardless of age, location and background. My sixty years old uncle, for example, has enrolled in an online MBA course in a different country. it would have been impossible before the internet


In conclusion, while I recognise the possible disadvantages of online courses, I consider it to be a positive development overall.

It is true that some parents are overly permissive and tend to spoil their children. In my opinion, it is not a good parenting style, and it could have a range of long-term negative consequences.

if parents want to raise respectful and well-behaved children, i believe that a certain amount of discipline is necessary.

The children of indulgent and lenient and parents are likely to grow up with several negative personality traits.

In conclusion, parents should help their children to develop self-control and respect for other, and i do not believe that permissive parenting style could support the objective.
