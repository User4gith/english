I am going to describe an apartment that I recently visited in the city centre of beijing. The apartment was on the tenth floor of a new block that has just been built. This building is on the edge of the main commercial area of the city, and the apartment overlooks several busiest shopping streets.

I would like my dream house to be built on top of a mountain covered with woods. My dream house will be two storey house and it has to be big enough for me  and my family.

Outside the house, I will paint it green, the same colour as the leaves of the trees in the woods. Since we live near the woods, I would like to have a garden to plant flowers and raise pets.

I am going to talk about one of my favourite educational tv programmes, which is a nature documentary called planet earth. There are eleven episodes of this programme, and each one featured a different habitat, such as mountains, caves, deserts and jungles. The aim of this programme was to take the viewer into those habitats, using spectacular footage of interesting animals, plants and landscapes.

I first saw this programme when it was broadcast by the bbc several years ago, I think it was shown every Sunday evening, which was the perfect time to watch a nature programme.

I found out about this programme because it was repeatedly advertised in the weeks before it was first aired. The trailers were really eye catching because they showed incredibly beautiful images of nature. It was these trailers that persuaded me to watch the first episode.


what i like most about the planet earth was its stunning photography and its global scope. For example, in the fresh water episode, they showed us the crocodiles in the river Nile, and river dolphins in the Amazon. I amazed at how they managed to film such interesting creatures in so many locations. I enjoyed learning about strange animal species and this programme opened my eyes to the hidden wonders of our planet.

In the modern work place, dress codes are changing as employers focus more on results than on the rules that employees must follow. Although I accept that idea that the way people dress should be seen as irrelevant in many work contexts, I believe that dress codes still exist for good reasons in certain professions.

On the one hand, some employees have stopped telling their staff how to dress, and I see this as a positive trend. [Some of] the most successful companies in the world, including technology giants like google and facebook are famous for their relaxed environment that they try to create. Employees are encouraged to dress casually, and even the company executives and leaders are rarely seen wearing anything other than T-shirts and jeans. [However], [while] managers and programmers are free to dress how they like, they are [expected] to [produce work of outstanding quality]. It is clear from the performance and the global dominance of such companies that strict dress codes are unnecessary in technology sector.

On the other hand, I [would also argue] that the rules regarding employees' clothing are still relevant in other work situation. We expect certain perfessionals, such as nurses, police officers and airplane pilots, to wear formal clothing. [These uniforms] might have a safety or practical function, but [perhaps more importantly] they identify the people's position or role in society.[Similarly,] A lawyer, school principal or politician may choose formal clothing in order to [portray] an image of authority, trustworthiness and diligence. I believe that most of us prefer to see them in smart, formal attire, even it is not strictly necessary.

In conclusion, while I accept the trend towards relaxed dress codes for workers, I do not see this as applicable to all occupations and sectors of the economy.

My dream house would be built on the top of a mountain covered with the woods. It would be a two-storey house and bit enough for me and my family.

Outside the house, I will paint it green, the same color as the leaves of the trees in the woods. Since we live near the woods, i'd like to have a garden to plant flowers and raise pets. Inside the house, I will put a big table in the middle of living room. so that we will have enough space to have a party during the holidays.
