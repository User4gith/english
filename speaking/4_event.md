The most important change in my life was that i have developed a habit of getting up early. I used to sleep late at night and get up late in the morning. I felt tired easily and i could not focus my mind on my studies.

I realised that it was a bad start of daily routine. so i decided to make a positive change at the beginning of this year. I decided to sleep at ten o'clock and get up at seven o'clock. at first i felt quite uncomfortable but i got used to it finally.

now i am energetic and in a very positive mood all day long. Most importantly, i can focus my mind on my studies and learning efficiency improves.

I was late for my first math class in the morning when i was in university, which was really an embarrassing experience in my life.

it was mainly due to the fact that i did hear my alarm go off in the morning. so i somehow overslept. finally when i got to the classroom, i found that the back door of this classroom was locked. finally i had to enter the room through the front door, it was really embarrassing when everyone saw me walk late in.

Now i try my best to be punctual. to be punctual is very important, it shows respect for others and in turn you can acquire respect from others.

Last friday, i took a taxi to my company in the morning. I have to say that the traffic in beijing is really a pain in the neck, especially rush hour. about half an hour later, i was stuck in a traffic jam.

i got quite upset at that time, my meeting began at ten o'clock and i needed to gave a presentation at the meeting, the problem was that there was only 20 minutes left.

I gave a call to my boss and told her that i might be late, she told me that she would arrange other things instead and i had better arrive as soon as possilbe. Fortunately, the flow of traffic eased up, and i arrived at my company on time.

Last month, i came across a student and he asked me to give my opinions in the questionnaire designed by him. this questionnaire was about what affected people's choice of healthy food.

He wanted to collected ideas from different people. so he asked everyone he came across for help. i encountered him and he asked me whether i could do him a favour, i said yes.

To be honest, i was not familiar with this field, but i tried my best to give my opinions. I told him that people's income would affect their choice, besides, people's knowledge about healthy food would also what they choose to eat.

I was very glad to help him beause i was willing to help others.
