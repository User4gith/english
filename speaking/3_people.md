I met him during my first day of college eight years ago in beijing. Since then, we have become friends and shared our ups and downs.

We do plenty of interesting and meaningful things like going to concerts or the library together. We used to attend lectures when we were in school and go to the library to do research. Now that we are both graduated, we usually meet up, and talk about our daily life and work.

I'd like to talk about my cousin. he is my cousin on my mother's side.

He is slim although he eats a lot, and he has short black hair and he always has a big smile.

He is excellent in sports and studies. He taught me how to play basketball when I was young, and he gets good grades in school. He is a kind person too, he helps me all the time

I like him not only because he is a sportsman but also because he has been a good example to me. he gives me suggestions when i am in trouble.

In the modern work place, dress codes are changing as employers focus more on results than on the rules that employees must follow. While I accept the idea that the way people dress should be seen as irrelevant in many work contexts, I believe that dress codes still exist for good reasons in certain professions.

On the one hand, many employers have stopped telling their staff how to dress, and I see this as an positive trend. Some fo the most successful companies in the world, including technology giants like google and facebook, are famous for their relaxed office environment that they try to create. Employees are encouraged to dress casually and even the company executives and leaders are rarely seen wearing anything other than T-shirts and jeans. However, while managers and programmers are free to dress how they like, they are expected to produce work of outstanding quality. It is clear from the performance and the global dominance of such companies that strict dress codes are completely unnecessary in technology sector.

However, I believe that the rules regarding employees' clothing are still relevant in other work situation. We expect certain professionals, such as nurses, police officers and airline pilots to wear uniforms. These uniforms might have a safety or practical function, but perhaps more importantly, they identify the person's position or role in society. Similarly, a lawyer, school principal or politician may choose to wear formal clothing in order to portray an image of authority, trustworthiness and diligence. I believe that most of us prefer to see them in formal, smart attire, [even if] it is not strictly necessary.

In conclusion, while I support the trend towards relaxed dress codes for workers, I do not see this as applicable to all occupations or sectors of the economy

It is true that parents shoulder a huge responsibility and that raising children is by no means an easy task. However, I do not accept the idea that we should therefore force all mothers and fathers to attend parenting courses.

In my view, the idea that all parents should take parenthood preparation courses is completely impractical. Many [prospective] parents have jobs and busy schedules, they might not be willing or able to attend regular parenting classes. This raises the question of whether or not those who missed the classes, or perhaps refused to attend, would be punished. I believe that it would be wrong to do this and so it would be impossible to enforce the idea of compulsory training for parents. Besides, even if parents could be forced to attend, I doubt that people would agree on what good parenting entails, and it would [therefore] be difficult to create a parenting course to suit everyone.

As well as being impractical, I would also argue that compulsory parenting courses are unnecessary. Mothers and fathers have [been raising] their children without formal help or offical interference for thousands of years. Parenting skill are learnt from family members, friends, neighbours and the surrounding culture. Perhaps more importantly, parents learn how to raise children by instinct, by trial and error and by getting to know their children. For example, a good parent will try different strategies when faced with a badly-behaved child, and will develop an understanding of what works to correct the behaviour. [None of this requires the intervention of a taught course].

In conclusion, compulsory parenting courses might seem like a good idea, but I believe that such a scheme would be unworkable and largely pointless.

I'd like to talk about my favourite season in beijing, autumn.

Without the humid air of summer and the dusty wind of spring, autumn is comfortably cool and filled with beauty from the colourful leaves.

The reason why I like autumn the best is that it is cool and clear, and it is an ideal season for outdoor activities like jogging and hiking

One of special things in this season is that it is the harvest season, so there are many fruits, like apples and oranges. The other special thing is the mid autumn festival.

The mid autumn festival falls on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, usually in september or october.

On that day, family members ate moon cakes and light fireworks.

Fireworks are very pretty but they are also the source of air pollution, people light them all night, and it is noisy.

The mid autumn is an important part of chinese life, it represents unity and happiness.

last summer, my mother and i went to climb mountain emei, a famous mountain located in southwest china. Unfortunately, during this journey, we got caught in a storm which was the worst weath i have experienced.

It was quite sunny when we set off, and we enjoyed the beautiful view of nature all the way, however, at the half way to top of the mountain, the rain pour down and a strong wind blew. There was no doubt that a storm was coming. We had to went back down the mountain.

When we arrived at our hotel, my mother and i were totally soaked. Both of us had a terrible cold the mext day. we had no choice but to stay at hotel for two days. This journey seemed to be ruined but it became the most unforgettable experience in my life.

I'd lile to talk about my cousin, he is my cousin on my mother's side.

He is slim althout he eats a lot, he has short black hair and he always has a big smile.

He is excellent in sports and studies. He taught me how to play basketball when i was young. He gets good grades in school,,

I'd like to talk about one of my favourite educational programmes, which is a nature documentary called planet earth. There are eleven episodes of this programme, and each one featured a different habitat such as mountains, caves, deserts and jungles. The aim of this programme was to take the view into those habitats, using spectacular footage of interesting animals, plants and landscapes.

I first saw this programme on television when it was broadcast by the bbc several years ago, i think it was shown every sunday evening which was the perfect time to watch a nature porgramme.

I found out about this programme because it was repeatedly advertised in the weeks before it was first aired. The trailers showed incredibly beautiful images of nature, it was the trailers that persuaded me to watch the first episode.

What i like most about this programme was its stunning photography and its glocal scope. For example, in the fresh water episode, they showed us the crocodiles in the river Nile, and river dolphins in the Amazon. I enjoyed learning about strange animal species and this programme opened my eyes to the hidden wonders of our planet.

I'd like my dream house to be built on top of a mountain coverd with the woods, my dream house would be a two storey house and big enough for me and my family.

Outside the house, I will paint it green, the same color as the leaves of the trees of the woods. Since we live near the woods, i'd like to have a garden to plant flowers and raise pets. Inside the house, i will put a big table in the middle of living room, so we will have enough space to have a party during the holidays.

I believe that everyone has a dream of having a peaceful place to live in, and so do i. I love the cool breeze and the peaceful atmosphere of mountain areas. What's more, living in a big house and living with my family makes me feel fulfilled.

People have different views about [the teaching of national versus global literature and history in school]. Personally, I support the idea that school children should first and foremost study the great books and historical events of their own countries.

On the one hand, there are several reasons why i believe that school should focus on teaching national literature and history. Firstly, children enjoy learning about where they live, and by studying the ideas, culture and history they would develop a sense of identity. At the same time, this approach is appealing to parents who studied the same books and historical events, and they could therefore help their children with school work. English children, for example, read Shakespeare and learn about the Battle of Hastings just as their parents did, and there would be educational continuity across the generations. Finally, an emphasis on national literature and history could give educators a narrower teaching scope, making curriculum design an easier task.

By contrast, the study of global events and foreign novels could lead to unnecessary confusion [and difficulty] for school pupils. For example, I do not get the point in [presenting Russian or Chinese history] to a British child who has not yet studied the history of his or her country in detail. Surely, [the child] would be more able to comprehend historical events that took place in London than those that happened in Moscow or Beijing. Besides, any exposure to international literature might require the teaching of a foreign language or [the use of translations] translation. Young people at primary or secondary school age are not ready for such complications.


In conclusion, i believe that it is [undesirable] for school to cover aspects of foreign literature and history, they should ground their pupils in the local culture instead.
