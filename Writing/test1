Nowadays, a lot of people live in foreign country where they have to speak a foreign
language. Some people think that this situation will cause serious social problems,
I tend to disagree with the point.

Firstly, it is misunderstanding between different cultures that can cause these
problems not a foreign language. For example, if people do not know about the local
customs and life style, it is possible for them to disobey some rules without intention
and the native people will be offended. for these customs, people who can not speak the
local language are able to take hand of them and .

Secondly, a conservative attitude is the other reason for these problems and practical problems.
If people can not keep an open mind to the different culture and life styles, conflicts between people
from different countries will happen. The possibility is high for People that do not
want to learn about different cultures to take an unfriendly attitude towards to
the person from different countries.

on the other hand, even if we live in a country where foreigners can communicate
with the local by the same language, there are a lot of social problems. Understanding and
open mind can reduce the number of these problems.

To sum up, a foreign language is a barrier for people to understand each other when
they live in a foreign country, but it is not the root cause of serious social problems
and practical problems. misunderstanding and the conservative attitude should be avoided,
if we want to build a harmony relationship with people from different countries.
