It is true that video surveillance has become commonplace in many cities in recent years. Although I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of privacy, I believe that there are far more benefits.

there are two main reasons why people might disapprove of the use of video cameras [in public places]. The first rejection is that these cameras invade our privacy, in the sense that we are constantly being watched by the authorities or by private security firms. Some people find it intrusive and feel that the recordings of their movements is a form of state control that curtails their individual freedom. The second argument against the proliferation of video cameras is that they are being used as an alternative of[to] police officers patrolling the streets, and if it is indeed happening, then it is unlikely [that member of the public will feel safer] for member of the public to feel safer.

Despite the drawbacks mentioned above, I believe that the use of video surveillance to monitor public areas is a positive measure. The main objective of video surveillance is to deter criminals and prevent crime. Fox example, petty criminals like shoplifters and pickpockets are less likley to operate in parts of cities where they know that they are being watched. Similarly, when crimes are committed, the police can use video recording to catch or prosecute offenders. In my view, video cameras offer valuable support to police officers, and they make cities safer for inhabitants, workers and visitors alike.

In conclusion, it seems to me that we gain more than we lose from the enhanced security that video cameras bring to our cities.
