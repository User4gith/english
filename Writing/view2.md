It is true that online courses are becoming a common feature of university education. While there are some drawbacks of internet based learning, I believe that there ara far more benefits.

The main drawback of online university courses is that there are less direct interactions. Students may not [have the opportunity] to engage face to face with their teachers, and [will instead] have to use written forms of communication. Similarly, students who study online do not come into contact with each other, [and this could have a negative impact on peer support, discussion and exchange of ideas]. For exampe, whereas students [on] traditional courses can attend seminars and discuss their subjects over coffee after lesson, online learners are restricted to chatting through websit forum areas. [These] learners may also lack motivation and element of competition that face to face group work brings.

Despite the drawbacks mentioned above, I believe that there are several advantages of online learning [I believe that online university courses are a positive development for various reasons]. Firstly, [they allow learners to study in a flexible way], students can study at whenever and wherever is convenient [meaning that they can work whenever and wherever is convenient], [and they can cover the material at their own pace]. Secondly, the cost of [a university] education could be great reduced, while [revenues] for institutions would increase as more students could be taught. Finally, online learning offers open access to anybody who is willing to study, [regradless of age, location, ability and background]. For example, my uncle, who is sixty five years old, has recently enrolled on [an] online MBA course in a different country, which would be impossible for the days that [which would have been impossible in the days before internet based education]

In conclusion, while I recognise the possible disadvantages of online learning, I consider it to be a positive development overall.

People's opinions differ as to whether or not school children should be given homework. While there are some strong arguments against the setting of homework, I believe that homework is a necessary aspect of education.

There are several reasons why people might argue that homework is unnecessary [homework is an unnecessary burden on children]. Firstly, [there is evidence to support the idea the homework does nothing to improve educational outcomes.] Some countries, such as Finland, where school children are not given homework, regularly top international educational league tables and outperform countries where setting homework is the norm. Secondly, many parents [would agree that] the school day is long enough, and leaves their children no time [too tired] to do further study when they return home. Finally, it is recognised that play time is just as beneficial as study time from the perspective of brain development.

In spite of the drawbacks mentioned above, I believe that homework is necessary for school children [I believe that homework has an important role to play in the schooling of children]. The main objective of homework is to help children to study alone and [The main benefit of homework is that it encourages independent learning and problem solving, as children are challenged to work through tasks alone and at their own pace]. In doing so, students [must apply the knowledge that they have learnt in the classroom]. For example, by doing mathematics at home, students consolidate their understanding of the concepts taught by their teacher at schools.In my view, it is important for children to develop an independent study habit because this prepares them to work alone as adults.

In conclusion, homework certainly has some drawbacks, but I believe that the benefits outweigh in the long term.





People's opinions differ as to whether or not school children should be given homework. While there are some string arguments against the setting of homework, I still believe that homework is a necessary aspect of education.

There are some reasons why people might argue that homework is an unnecessary burden on children. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that homework does nothing to improve educational outcomes. Countries such as Finland, where school children are not given homework, regularly top international educational league tables and outperform countries where setting homework is the norm. Seconly, many parents would agree that the school day is already long enough, and leaves their children too tired to do further study when they return home. Finally, it is recognised that play time is just as beneficial as study time from the perspective of brain development.

It is true that some parents are overly permissive and tend to spoil their chidren. In my view, this is not a good parenting style, and it can have a range of negative long-term consequences.

If parents want to raise respectful and well-behaved children, I believe that a ceratin amount of discipline is necessary. Having worked with childern myself, I have learnt that clear expectations and boundaries are necessary and it is important to be able to say no to children who misbehave or try to push against the boundaries. This is the only way to help young people to regualte their desires and develop self-control. In my view, parents who do the opposite and constantly give in to their children's demands are [actually doing more harm than good]. They are failing their children rather than being kind to them.

The children [of indulgent or lenient parents] may have some negative traits [are likely to grow up with some negative traits]. The first negative impact is that these children will become self-centred adults who show little consideration for feelings or needs of other [The first and most obvious danger is that ]. [One consequence of]Such an attitude [could be that] they are unable to work successfully in teams with other colleagues. The other trait in such people is impulsiveness [A second negative trait in such people]. A person who has never lived with boundaries may lack petience to carefully consider options before making decisions, this may lead to, for example, compulsive shopping, unwise financial decisions and even criminal activity.

In conclusion, parents should help their children to develop self-control and respect for others, and I do not believe that permissive parenting style supports the objective.
