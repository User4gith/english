It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?

Some people believe that technological developments lead to the loss of traditional cultures. I partly agree with this assertion; while it may be true in the case of some societies, others seem to be unaffected by technology and the modern world.

On the one hand, the advances in technology that have driven industrialisation in developed countries have certainly contributed to the disappearance of traditional ways of life. For example, in pre-industrial Britain, generations of families grew up in the same small village communities. These communities had a strong sense of identity, due to their shared customs and beliefs. However, developments in transport, communications and manufacturing led to the dispersal of families and village communities as people moved to the cities in search of work. Nowadays most British villages are inhabited by commuters, many of whom do not know their closest neighbours.

On the other hand, in some parts of the world traditional cultures still thrive. There are tribes in the Amazon Rainforest, for example, that have been completely untouched by the technological developments of the developed world. These tribal communities continue to hunt and gather food from the forest, and traditional skills are passed on to children by parents and elders. Other traditional cultures, such as farming communities in parts of Africa, are embracing communications technologies. Mobile phones give farmers access to information, from weather predictions to market prices, which helps them to prosper and therefore supports their culture.

In conclusion, many traditional ways of life have been lost as a result of advances in technology, but other traditional communities have survived and even flourished.

It is true that governments shoulder a huge responsibility and that buying a house is by no means an easy task for people. However I completely disagree with the idea that governments should therefore offer free housing for people who can not afford it.

In my opinion, the idea that governments should offer free housing for poor people is completely impractical. Firstly, it would be a great financial burden on governments to buy or build free housing. Secondly, making rules to identify people who can get a free housing is difficult. For example, some people might make fake identities to fit the rules. Finally, even if governments could support it, I doubt that people would agree on what good free housing entails, and so it would be difficult to buy or build good free housing to suit everyone.

As well as being impractical, I would also argue that offering free housing for poor people is unnecessary. People have been buying or building their own houses without formal help or official interference for thousands of years. People can get support from family members, friends or even neighbours to buy or build house. Perhaps more importantly, buying or building house by ourselves represents freedom. For example, I would like my dream house to be built on a mountain covered with the woods, however, free housing does not have this function.

In conclusion, offering free house for poor people might seem like a good idea, but I believe that it would certainly be unworkable and largely pointless.
