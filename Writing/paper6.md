It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste. Although I accept that new legislation to force people to recycle could help this situation, I do not agree that a recycling law is the only measure that governments should take.

In my view, a new recycling law would be just one possible way to tackle the waste problem. Governments could make it a legal obligation for householders to separate all waste into different bins. There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging from a small fine to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders. These measures would act as a deterrent and encourage people to obey the recycling law. As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners could lead to a clean, waste-free environment for everyone.

However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law. It might be more effective if politicians put education, rather than punishment, at the centre of a recycling campaign. For example, children could be taught about recycling in schools, and homeowners could be informed about the environmental impact of household waste. Another tactic that governments could use would be to create stricter regulations for the companies that produce the packaging for household products. Finally, money could also be spent to improve recycling facilities and systems, so that waste is processed more effectively, regardless of whether or not people separate it correctly in the home.

In conclusion, perhaps we do need to make recycling a legal requirement, but this would certainly not be the only way to encourage people to dispose of their waste more responsibly.

In the modern work place, dress codes are changing as employers focus more on results than the rules that employees must follow. While I agree that the way people dress should be seen irrelevant in many work contexts, I believe that dress codes still exist for good reasons in certain professions.

On the one hand, many employers have stopped telling their staff how to dress, and I see this as a positive trend. Some of the most successful companies in the world, including technology giants like google and facebook, are famous for their relaxed office environment that they try to create. Employees are encouraged to dress casually, and even the company executives and leaders are rarely seen wearing anything other than T-shirts and jeans. However, while managers and programmers are free to dress how they like, they are expected to produce work of outstanding quality. It is clear from the performance and global dominance of such companies that strict dress codes are completely unnecessary in technology sector.

However, I would also argue that rules regarding employees' clothing are still [relevant] in other work situations. We expect certain professionals, such as nurses, police officers and airline pilots, to wear uniforms. These uniforms may have a practical or safety function, but perhaps more importantly, they [identify] the person's position or role in society. Similarly, a lawyer, politician and school principal may choose to wear [formal clothing ] in order to portray an image of authority, trustworthiness, and diligence. I believe that [most of us] prefer to see these professionals in smart, formal attire, even if it is not strictly necessary.

In conclusion, I support the trend towards relaxed dress codes for workers, but I do not see it [as] applicable to all occupations or sectors of the economy.

Some leisure activities become fashionable for a short time and then disappear when a new trend comes along, whereas others seems to be [perennially] popular. I can therefore only partly agree with the [assertion] that hobbies reflect changine fashions rather than our true interests.

On the one hand, it is true that some hobbies are simply passing trends. Children and teenagers, in particular, are attracted to whatever activity is currently popular among their peers. My ten years old niece, for example, seems to have a new interest every month, as she joins in the latest craze that sweeps through her primary school. Over the last year or so, she has bee n obsessed with Rubik's cubes, fidget spinners, squidgies and slime. In a similarly way, there have been several different fitness trends for adults over recent years, from jogging to yoga to circuit training, and I doubt that whether the majority of participants continued to enjoy these activities in the long term.

On the other hand, many people spend their free time doing popular activities that are from trendy. One good example would be the game chess. Children and adults who enjoy playing chess are certainly not following a new trend or wasting their time on something that they do not truly like. [On the contrary], they are passionate about a game that has existed for hundreds of years, and they find it [inherently] fascinating and absorbing. I would say the same about many other hoobies, from reading to swimming.

In conclusion, some of hobbies and interests could change time by time according to individuals, while some of them are preferred by people.


People seem to be either excited or worried about the future impact of ai. Personally I can understand the two opposing points of view. I both fascinated by developments in ai and apprehensive about its possible negative effects.

On the one hand, the increasing intelligence of technology should bring some obvious benefits. Machines are clearly be able to do many jobs better than humans can, especially in areas that require high levels of accuracy and calcualtions using large amounts of data. For example, robots are being developed that can carry out surgical procedures with greater precision than a human doctor, and we already have cars that use sensors and cameras to drive themselves. Such technologies will improve safety by reducing the likelihood of human errors. It is easy to imagine how these developments, and many others, will steadily improve our quality of life.

On the other hand, I share the concerns of people who believe that ai may harm us if we are not careful. In the short term, it is likely that we will see a rise in unemployment as workers in various industries are replaced by machines or software programs. For example, self-driving vehicles are expected to cause redundancies in driving jobs, such as lorry drivers, bus drivers, and taxi drivers. In the medium term, if intelligent machines gradually take jobs away from human, we will find that people become deskilled and lose their sense of purpose in life. A longer term fear is that computers become so intelligent that they begin to make decisions without human oversight and without regard for our well-being.

In conclusion, while intelligent machines can no doubt improve our lives in many ways, the potential risks of such technologies should not be ignored.
