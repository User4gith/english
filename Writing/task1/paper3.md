The diagrams illustrate some proposed changes to the centre of the town.

It is clear that the principal change to the town will be the construction of a ring road around the centre. Various other developments with regard to shops and housing will accompany the building of this road.

Looking at the map as it is now, we can see that a main road runs through its centre from east to west. The second map shows a planned pedestrianisation of this road. Traffic will be diverted on to a dual carriageway that will from a ring around the centre.

Currently there is a row of shops along either side of this main road. However, it appears that the shops along the north side of the new pedestrian street will be demolished to make way for a bus station, shopping centre, car park and new housing. The shops along the south side of this street will remain, but it seems that the town's park will be reduced in size so that more new houses can be built within the ring road.
