In many cities the use of video cameras in public places is being increased in order to reduce crime, but some people believe that these measures restrict our individual freedom.
Do the benefits of increased security outweigh the drawbacks?


It is true that video surveillance has become commonplace in many cities in recent years. While I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of privacy, I believe that the benefits do outweigh the drawbacks.

There are two main reasons why people might disapprove of the use of video cameras in public places. The first objection is that these cameras invade our privacy, in the sense that we are constantly being watched by the authorities or by private security firms. Many people find this intrusive and feel that the recording of their movements is a form of state control that curtails their individual freedom. The second argument against the proliferation of CCTV cameras is that they are being used as an alternative to police officers patrolling the streets. If this is indeed happening, then it is unlikely that members of the public will feel safer.

In spite of the drawbacks mentioned above, I believe that the use of video cameras to monitor public areas is a positive measure. The key objective of video surveillance is to deter criminals and to prevent crime. For example, petty criminals like shoplifters and pickpockets are less likely to operate in parts of cities where they know that they are being watched. At the same time, when crimes are committed, the police can use video evidence to catch and prosecute offenders. Therefore, in my view, video cameras offer valuable support to police officers, and they make cities safer for inhabitants, workers and visitors alike.

In conclusion, it seems to me that we gain more than we lose from the enhanced security that CCTV cameras bring to our cities.

It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste. Although I accept that new legislation to force people to cycyle could help this situation, I believe that a recycling law would not be the only measure that governments should take.

In my view, a new recycling law would be [just one possibe way to tackle the waste problem]. Governments could make it a legal obligation for household to separate all waste into different bins. There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging from a small fine, to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders. [These measures would act as] a detrrent and encourage [people to obey the recycling law]. As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners could lead to a clean, waste-free environment for everyone.

However, I believe that govenments should do more than [simply] introduce a recycling law. It might be more effective if politicians put education, rather than punishment, at the center of a recycling campaign. For example, children could be taught about recycling at schools, and homeowners could be informed about the environmental impact of household waste. Another tactic that governments could use would be to [create] stricter regualations for the companies that produce the packaging for household products. Finally, money could also to spend to improve recycling facilities and systems, and so that waste is processed more effectively, regardless of whether or not people separate waste correctly in the home.

In conclusion, perhaps we do need make recycling a legal requirement, but I believe that it would [this would certainly] not be the only way to encourage people separate [dispose of] their waste more responsibly.

In the modern work place, dress codes are changing as employers focus more on results than on the rules that employees must follow. While I agree that the way people dress [should be seen as] irrelevant in many work contexts, I believe that dress codes still exist for good reasons in certain professions.

On the one hand, many employees have stopped telling their staff how to dress, and I see this as a positive trend. Some [of the] most successful companies in the world, including technology giants like goole and facebook, are famous for their relaxed environment that they try to create. Employees are encouraged to dress casually, and even the company executives and leaders are rarely seen wearing anything other than T-shirts and jeans. However, while managers and programmers are free to dress how they like, they are expected to produce work [of] outstanding quality. It is clear from the performance and [global] dominance of such companies that [strict] dress codes are completely unnecessary in technoly sector.

However, I would also argue that rules regarding employees' clothing are still relevant in other work situations. We expect certain professionals, such as nurses, police officers and airline pilots, to wear uniforms. These uniforms may have a practical or safety function, but perhaps more importantly, they identify the person's positin or role in society. Similarly, a lawyer, politician or school principal may choose to wear formal clothing in order to portray an image of authority, trustworthiness and diligence. I believe that most of us prefer to see these professionals in formal attire, even if it is not strictly necessary.

In conclusion, I support the trend towards relaxed dress codes for workers, but I do not see this as applicable to all occupations or sectors of the economy.

It is true that parents shoulder a huge responsibility and that raising children is by no means an eays task. However, I completely disagree with the idea that we should therefore force all mothers and fathers to attend parenting courses.

In my view, the idea that all future parents should take a parenthood preparation course is completely impractical. Many prospective parents have jobs and many schedules, and they may not be willing or able to attend regular parenting classes. This raises the question of whether those who missed the classes, or perhaps refused to attend, would be punished. I believe that it would be wrong to do this, and it would [therefore] be impossible to enforce the idea of compulsory training for parents. Besides, even if parents could be forced to attend, I doubt that people would agree on what good parenting entails, and it would be difficult to create a parenting course to suit everyone.

As well as being impractical, I would also argue that training courses for parents are unnecessary. Mothers and fathers have been raising their childern without formal help or official interference for thousands of years. Parenting skills are learnt from family members, friends, neighbours and the surrounding culture. Perhaps more importantly, adults learn to be good parents [by instinct], by trial and error, and by getting to know their children. For example, a good parent will try different strategies when faced with a badly-behaved child, and will gradually develop an understanding of what works to correct the behaviour. None of this requires the intervention of a taught course.

In conclusion, while compulsory parenting courses might seem like a good idea, I believe that such a scheme would be unworkable and largely pointless.

People have different views about teaching [of] national versus global literature and history in schools. Personally I support the idea that children should first and foremost study the great books and historical events of their own countries.

There are several reasons why I believe that schools should focus on teaching national literature and history. Firstly, children enjoy learing about where they live, and by studying the ideas, culture and history of their own countries they [begin to] develop a sense of identity. At the same time, this approach is appealing to parents, who studied the same books and historical events, and can therefore help their children with school work. English children, for example, read Shakespeare and learn about the Battle of Hastings just as their parents did, and there [could be] educational continuity across the generations. Finally, an emphasis on teaching national literature and history gives educators a narrower teaching scope, making curriculum design an easier task.

By contrast, the study of global events and foreign novels could cause unnecessary difficulty and confusion for school pupils. For example, I do not see the point in presenting Russian and Chinese history to a British child who has not yet studied the history of his or her country in detail. Surely, the child would be more able to comprehend historical events that took place in London that those that happened in Moscow or Beijing. Similarly, any exposure to international literature would require the teaching of a foreign language or the use of translations. Young people at primary or secondary school age are not ready for such complications.

In conclusion, I believe that it is undesirable for schools to cover aspects of foreign literature and histroy, they should ground their pupils in the local cultrue instead.


People seem to be either excieted or worried about the future impact of ai. Personally, I can understand the two opposing [points] of view. I am both fascinated by developments in ai and apprehensive about its possible negative effects.

On the one hand, the increasing intelligence of technology [should bring] some obvious benefits. Machines are clearly able to do many jobs better than humans can, especially in areas that require high levels of accuracy or calculations using large amounts of data. For example, robots are bing developed that can carry out surgical procedures with greater precision than a human doctor, and we already have cars that use sensors and cameras to drive themselves. Such technologies can improve safety by reducing the likelihood of human errors. It is easy to imagine how these developments, and many others, will steadily improve our quality of life.

On the othe hand, I share the concerns of people who believe that ai may harm us if we are not careful. In the short term, it is likely that we will see a rise in unemployment as workers in various industries are replaced by machines or software programs. For example, self-driving vehicles are expected to cause redundancies in driving jobs, such as lorry drivers, taxi drivers and bus drivers. In the medium term, if intelligent machines gradually take jobs away from [humans], we will find that people become deskilled and lose the sense of purpose in life. A longer term fear is that computers become so intelligent that they begin to make decisions without human oversight and without regard for our well-bing.


In conclusion, while intelligent machines can no doubt improve our lives in many ways, the potential risks of such technologies should not be ignored.

Some leisure activities become fashionable for a short time and then disappear when a new trend comes along, whereas others seem to be perennially popular. I can therefore just partly agree with the assertion that hobbies reflect changing fashions rather than our true interest.

On the one hand, it is true that some hobbies are simply passing trends. Children and teenagers, in particular, are attracted to whatever activity is currently popular among their peers. My ten years old niece, for example, seems to have a new interest every month, as she joins in with the latest craze that sweeps through her primary school. Over the last year or so, she has been obsessed with the Rubik's cubes, fidget spinners, squidgies ans slime. In a similar way, there have been several different fitness trend for adults over recent years, from jogging to yoga to circuit training, and I doubt whether the majority of participants continued to enjoy these activities in the long term.

On the other hand, many people spend their free time doing activities that are far from trendy. One good example would be the game chess. Children and adults who enjoy playing chess are certainly not follwing a new trend or wasting their time on something that they do not [truly] like. In the contrary, they are passionate about a game that has existed for hundreds of years and find it inherently fascinating and absorbing. I would say the same about many other hobbies, from reading to swimming.

In conclusion,


It is true that video survillance has become commonplace in many cities in recent years. While I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of privacy, I believe that the benefits do outweigh the drawbacks.

There are two main reasons why people might disapprove of the use of video cameras in public places. The first objection is that these cameras invade our privacy, in the sense that we are constantly being watched by the authorities and by private security firms. Many people find it intrusive and feel that the recording of their movements is a form of state control that curtails their individual freedom. The second argument against the proliferation of CCTV cameras is that they are being used as an alternative to police officers patrolling the streets. If it is indeed happening, then it is unlikely that members of public will feel safer.

In spite of the drawbacks mentioned above, I believe that the use of video cameras to monitor public areas is a positive measure. The key objective of video surveillance is to deter criminals and prevent crime. For example, petty criminals like shoplifters and pickpockets are less likely to operate in parts of cities where they know that they are being watched. [At the same time] when crimes are committed, the police can use video evidence to catch and prosecute offenders. Therefore, in my view, video cameras offer valuable support to police offers, and they make cities safer for inhabitants, workers and visitors alike.

In conclusion, it seems to me that we gain more than we lose from the enhanced security that CCTV cameras bring to our cities.
