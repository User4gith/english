This is the only way to help young people to regulate their desires and develop self-control. In my view, parents who do the opposite and constantly give in to their children's demands, are actually doing more harm than good.

The children of indulgent or lenient parents are likely to grow up with several negative personality traits. The first and most obvious danger is that these children will become self-centred adults who show little consideration for the feelings or needs of others.

It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste. While I accept that new legislation to force people to recycle could help this situation, I believe that a recycling law is not the only measure that governments should take.

I believe that a new recycling law is just one possible way to tackle the waste problem. Goverments could make it a legal obligation for householders to separate all waste into different bins. There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging from a small fine to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders. These measures would act as a deterrent and encourage people to obey this recycling law. As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners can lead to a clean, waste-free environment for everyone.

However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law. It might be more effective, if politicians put eduction, rather than punishment, at the center of a recycling campaign. For example, children could be taught about recycling in schools, and homeowners could be informed about the environmental impact of household waste. Another tactic that governments could use would be to create stricter regulations for the companies that produce packaging for household products. At the same time, money could also be spent to improve recycling facilities and systems, so that waste is processed more effectively, regardless of whether or not people separate waste correctly in the home.

In conclusion, perhaps a new recycling law might seem like a good idea, but I believe that it certainly would not be the only way to encourage people to dispose of their waste more reponsibly.
