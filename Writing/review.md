It is true that online courses are becoming a common feature of university education. Although there are some drawbacks of internet based learning, I would argue that there are for mor benefits.

The main drawback of the trend towards online university courses is that there is less direct interaction. Students may not have the opportunity to engage face to face with their teachers, and will instead have to rely on written forms of communication. Similarly, students who study online do not come into direct contact with each other, and this could have a negative impact on peer support, discussion and exchange of ideas. For example, whereas students on traditional courses can attend seminars and even discuss their subjects over coffee after lessons, online learners are restricted to chatting through website forum areas. These learners may also lack motivation and element of competition that face to face group work brings.

Despite the negatives mentioned above, I believe that online university courses [are] a positive development for various reasons. Firstly, they allow learners to study in a flexible way, meaning that they can work whenever and wherever is convenient, and they can cover the material at their own pace. Secondly, the cost of a university education can be greatly reduced, while revenues for institutions may increase as more students can be taught. Finally, online learning offers open access to anybody, who is willing to study, regardless of age, location, ability and background. For example, my uncle, who is sixty five years old, has recently enrolled on an online MBA course in a different country, which woudl have been impossible in the days before internet based education.

In conclusion,  while I recognise the possible disadvantages of online learning, I consider it to be a positive development overall.



People's opinions differ as to whether or not school children should be given howework. While there are some strong arguments against the setting of homework, I still believe that homework is a necessary aspect of education.

There are severel reasons why people might argue that homework is an unnecessary burden on children. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that homework does nothing to improve educational outcomes. Countries such as Finland, where school children are not given homework, regularly top international educational league tables and outperform nations where setting homework is the norm. Secondly, many parents would agree that the school day is already long enough, and leaves their children too tired to do further study when they return home. Finally, it is recognised that play time is just as beneficial as study time from the perspective of brain development.

In spite of the drawbacks mentioned above, I support the view that homework has an important role to play in schooling of children. The key objective of homework is that it encourages children independent learning and problem solving, as children are challenged to work through tasks alone and at their own pace. In doing so, students must apply their knowledge that they have learnt in the classroom. For example, by doing mathematics exercises at home, students consolidate their understanding of the concepts taugth by their teacher at school. I believe that it is important for children to develop [an] independent study habit because this prepares them to work alone as adults.

In conclusion, homework certainly has its drawbacks, but I believe that the benefits outweigh them in the long term.


In conclusion, while I recognise the possible disadvantages of online learning, I consider it to be an positive development overall.


It is true that [some] parents are overly permissive and tend to spoil their children. I believe that it is not a good parenting style, and it can have a range of negative long-term consequences.

If parents want to raise respectful and well-bahaved children, I believe that [a certain amount of discipline is necessary]. Having worked wiht children myself, I have learnt that clear expectations and boundaries are necessary, [and it is important to be able to say no to children] when they misbehave or they try to push against these boundaries. This is the only way to help young people to regualte their desires and develop self-control. In my view, parents who do the opposite and constantly give in to their children's demands, are actually doing harm than good. They are failing their children rather than being kind to them.

The children of indulgent or lenient parents are likely to grow up with several negative personality traits. The first and most obvious danger is that they will become self centred adults who show little consideration for the feelings or needs of others. One consequence of such an attitude [could be] that they are unable to work successfully in teams with other colleagues. The second trait in such people could be implusiveness. A person who has never lived with boundaries is likely to lack patience to carefully consider options before making decisions. This may lead, for example, to compulsive shopping, unwise financial decisions, or even criminal activity.

In conclusion, parents should help their children to develop self-control and repect for others, and I do not believe that permissive parenting style can support the objective.

It is true that video surveillance has become commonplace in many cities in recent years. While I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of privacy, I believe that the benefits do outweigh the drawbacks.

There are two main reasons why people might disapprove of the use of video cameras in public places. The first objection is that these cameras invade our privacy, in the sense that we are constantly being watched by the authorites or by private security firms. Many people find it intrusive and feel that the recording of their movements is a form of state control that curtails their individual freedom. The second argument against the proliferation of CCTV cameras is that they are being used as an alternative to police officers patrolling the streets. If it is indeed happening, it is unlikely that members of public will feel safer.

In spite of the drawbacks mentioned above, I believe that the use of video cameras to monitor public areas is a positve measure. The key objective of video surveillance is to deter criminals and prevent crime. For example, petty criminals like shoplifters and pickpockets are less likely to operate in parts of cities where they know that they are being watched. At the same time, when crimes are committed, the police can use video evidence to catch and prosecute offenders. In my view, video cameras offers valuable support to the police, and they can make cities safer for inhabitants, workes and visitors alike.

In conclusion, it seems to me that we gain more than we lose from the enhanced security that CCTV cameras bring to our cities.

It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste. Although I accept that new legislation to force people to recycle could help this situation, I believe that a recycling law would not be the only measure that governments should take.

In my view, a new recycling law is just one possible way to tackle the waste problem. Governments [could] make it a legal obligation for householders to separate all waste into different bins. There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging from a small fine to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders. These measures would act as a deterrent and encourage people to obey the recycling law. As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners could [lead to] a clean, waste-free environment for everyone.

However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law. It might be more effective, if politicians put education, rather than punishment, at the centre of a recycling campaign. For example, children could be taught about recycling in school, and homeowners could be informed about the environmental impact of household waste. Another tactic that governments could use would be to create stricter regulations for the companies that produce packaging for household products. At the same time, money could also be spent to improve recycling facilities and systems, so that waste is processed more effectively, regardless of whether or not people separate waste correctly in the home.

In conclusion, perhaps we do need to make recycling a legal requirement, I believe that it would certainly not be the only way to encourage people to dispose of their waste more responsibly.

Some leisure activities become fashionable for a short time and then disappear when a new trend comes along, whereas others seem to be perennially popular. I can therefore [only] partly agree with the assertion that hobbies reflect changing fashion rather than our true interest.

On the one hand, it is true that some hobbies are simply passing trends. Children and teenagers, in particular, are attracted to whatever actvity is currently popular among their peers. My ten years old niece, for example, seems to have a new interest every month, as she joins in with the latest craze [in][that sweeps through] her primary school. Over the last year or so, she has obsessed with the Rubik's cubes, fidget spinners, squidgies and slime. In the similar way, there [has][have] been several different fitness trends for adults over recent years, from circuit training to yoga to jogging, and I doubt whether the majority of participants continued to enjoy these activities in the long term.

On the other hand, many people spend their free time doing activities that are from trendy. One good example would be the game chess. Children and audlts who enjoy playing chess are certainly not following a new trend and wasting their time on something that they do not truly like. [In the contrary ][On the contrary], they are passionate about a game that has existed for hundreds of years and find it [inherently] fascinating and absorbing. I would say the same about many other hobbies, from reading to swimming.

In conclusion, some hobbies and interests are [changeable] by time according to individuals, while some of them are preferred by people.



People seem to be either excited or worried about the future impact of ai. Personally I can understand the two opposing points of view, I am both fascianted by developments in ai and apprehensive about its possible negative effects.

On the one hand, the increasing intelligence of technology should bring some obvious benefits. Machines are clearly able to do many jobs better than humans can, especially in areas that require high levels of accuracy and calculations using large amounts of data. For example, robots are being developed to carry out surgical procedures with greater precision than a human doctor, and we already have cars that use cameras and sensors to drive themselves. [Such technologies] can improve safety by reducing the likelihood of human errors. It is easy to imagine how these developments, and many others will steadily improve the quality of our life.

On the other hand, I share the concerns of people who believe that ai may harm us if we are  not careful. In the short term, it is likely that we will see a rise in unemployment as workers in various industries are replaced by machines or software programs. For example, self-driving vehicles are expected to cause redundancies in driving jobs, such as lorry drivers, taxi drivers, and bus drivers. In the medium term, if intelligent technologies will gradually take jobs away from [human][humans], we [may] find that people become deskilled and lose the sense of purpose in life. A long term fear is that computers become so intelligent that they begin to make decisions without human[adj] oversight and without regarding for our well-being.

In conclusion, while such technologies can no doubt improve our lives in many ways, the potential risks of intelligent technology should not be ignored.



People have different views about the teaching of national versus global literature and history in schools. In my opinion, I support the idea that children should first and foremost study the great books and historical events of their own countries.

There are several reasons why I believe that schools should focus on teaching national literature and history. Firstly, children enjoy learning about where they live, and by studying the ideas, history and culture of their own countries they [begin to] develop a sense of identity. At the same time, this approach is appealing to parents, who [studied the same books and historical events] and  can therefore help their children with school work. English children, for example, read Shakespeare and study the Battle of Hastings just as their parents did, and there is educational continuity across the generations. Finally, an emphasis on national literature and history gives educators a narrower teaching scope, making curriculum design an easier task.

By contrast, the study of global events and foreign novels [could] cause unnecessary difficulty and confusion for school children. For example, I do not see the point [in] presenting Russian or Chinese history to a British child who has not yet studied the history of his or her own country in detail.[Surely] The child [would be] more able to comprehend historical events that took place in London than those that happened in Moscow or Beijing. Besides, any exposure to international literature is likely to require the teaching of a foreigh laguage or the [use of] translations. Young people at primary or secondary school are simply not ready for such complications.

In conclusion, I believe that it is undersirable for schools to cover aspects of foreigh literature and history, they should ground their pupils in the local culture instead.


It is true that parents shoulder a huge responsibility and that raising children is by no means an easy task. However, I completely disagree with the idea that [we should therefore force] all moters and fathers to take a parenting course.

In my view, the idea that all future parents should take parenthood preparation courses is completely impractical. Many prospective parents have jobs and many schedules, and they may not be willing or able to attend regular parenting classes. This raises the question of whether or not those who missed the classes, or perhaps refused to attend, would be punished. I believe that this would be wrong to do this, and it would [therefore] be impossible to enforce the idea of compulsory training for parents. Besides, even if parents could be forced to attend, I doubt that people would agree on what good parenting entails, and so it [would be] difficult to create a parenting course to suit everyone.

As well as being impractical, I would also argue that compulsory training courses [are] unnecessary. Mothers and fathers have raised their children withoud formal help or official interference for thousands of years. Parenting skills are learnt from family members, friends, neighbours and the surrounding culture. [Perhaps more importantly,] Adults learn to be good parents by instinct, by trial and error, by getting to know their children. For example, a good parent will try different [strategies] when faced with a badly-behaved child, and will develop an understanding of what works to correct the behaviour. None of this requires the intervention [of a taught course.]

In conclusion, while compulsory parenting courses might seem like a good idea, I believe that such a scheme would be impractical and largely pointless.


In the modren work place, dress codes are changing as employers focus more on results than on the rules that employees must follow. While [I agree that] the way people dress should be seen [as] irrelevant in many work contexts, I believe that dress codes still exists for good reasons in certain professions.

On the one hand, many employers have stopped telling their staff how to dress, and I see this as an positive trend. Some of the most successful companies in the world, including the technology giants like goolge and facebook, are famous for their relaxed environment that they try to create. Employers are encoraged to dress casually, and even the executives and leaders are rarely seen wearing anything other than T-shirts and jeans. However, while the managers and programmers are free to dress how they like, they are expected to [produce work] of outstanding quality. It is clear from the performance and the global dominance [of such companies] that strict dress codes are completely unnecessary in the technology sector.

However, I would also argue that rules regarding employees' clothing still relevant in other situations. We expect certain profeesionals, such as nurses, police officers and airline pilots, to wear uniforms. These unifroms may have a safety or practical funtion, but perhaps more importantly, they identify the person's position or role in society. Similarly, a lawyer, school principal or politician may choose to wear formal clothing in order to protray an image of authority, trustworthiness and diligence. I believe that most of us prefer to see these professionals in smart, formal attire, even it is not strictly necessary.

In conclusion, I support the trend towards relaxed dress codes for workers, while I believe that it would certainly not be for all occupations or sectors of the economy.

In conclusion, while I support the trend towards relaxed dress codes for workers, I do not see this as applicable to all occupations or sectors of the economy.
